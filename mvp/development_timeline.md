## Total Timeline: 17-21 weeks (4-5 months)

## Notes
1. Timeline assumes:
   - 1 full-stack developer
   - 1 UI/UX designer (part-time)
   - 1 project manager (part-time)

2. Timeline can be shortened with:
   - Additional developers
   - Pre-built UI components
   - Parallel development

3. Not included in timeline:
   - Client feedback iterations
   - Extended testing periods
   - Training and documentation
   - Deployment and DevOps setup

## Risk Factors
1. Scope changes during development
2. Integration complexity with existing systems
3. Custom requirements from initial users
4. Learning curve for new technologies

## Acceleration Possibilities
1. Using pre-built UI component libraries
2. Implementing CI/CD from start
3. Agile development methodology
4. Regular releases for early feedback
