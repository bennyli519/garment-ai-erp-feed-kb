# Garment Manufacturing SaaS System Background

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform specifically designed for garment manufacturing companies. The system will serve as an all-in-one Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution to help garment manufacturers streamline their operations and improve efficiency.

## Target Users
- Garment manufacturing companies
- Clothing factories
- Textile production facilities
- Manufacturing management teams

## Full System Scope
The complete system will encompass several key management modules:

1. **Purchase Management**
   - Supplier management
   - Raw material procurement
   - Purchase order tracking
   - Cost management

2. **Inventory Management**
   - Raw material inventory
   - Finished goods tracking
   - Warehouse management
   - Stock movement tracking

3. **Financial Management**
   - Accounting integration
   - Cost tracking
   - Invoice management
   - Financial reporting

4. **Human Resources Management**
   - Employee information management
   - Attendance tracking
   - Performance management
   - Worker efficiency monitoring

5. **Piece-Rate Salary Management**
   - Production output tracking
   - Worker productivity monitoring
   - Salary calculation
   - Performance-based compensation

## MVP Focus
The initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on implementing a robust multi-tenant system with the following key features:

1. **Multi-tenant Architecture**
   - Company-level data isolation
   - Secure data partitioning
   - Tenant management system
   - User access control

2. **Core Requirements**
   - Company registration and onboarding
   - User management within companies
   - Role-based access control
   - Basic administrative functions

## Technical Considerations
- Data isolation between different companies
- Scalable architecture to support multiple tenants
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Efficient database design for multi-tenancy
- API-first approach for future extensibility

## Future Expansion
The system is designed to be modular, allowing for gradual expansion to include all planned features while maintaining the core multi-tenant architecture established in the MVP phase.
