# Permission Framework Story

## Story Description
As a system architect, I need to implement a comprehensive permission framework that supports role-based access control and fine-grained permissions.

## Acceptance Criteria

  - Action-based permissions
  - Scope-based permissions

### 2. Permission Framework
- [ ] Core Components
  - Permission checker hooks
  - Permission guard components
  - API route protection
  - Resource access control
- [ ] Permission Logic
  - Permission inheritance
  - Role composition
  - Permission resolution
  - Scope validation

### 3. Database Schema
- [ ] Role Models
  - Role definitions
  - Permission mappings
  - User associations
  - Tenant scoping
- [ ] Permission Storage
  - Permission definitions
  - Role-permission mappings
  - Custom permissions
  - Audit logging

### 4. Integration Points

- [ ] Permissions are enforced
- [ ] UI respects permissions
- [ ] API routes are protected
- [ ] Audit logging works
